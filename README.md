# MapReduce
MapReduce Applications

This repository contains two MapReduce applications, calucating variance and finding friend connections.

Each of the folder contains application_name.py, test_file.json and output_result.txt. Both application_name.py have to run with the MapReduce.py framework, provided in this folder, in order to work functionally. 

I am welcome to open up any comments and feedbacks!
